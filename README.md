# 100 Days of Coding Challeng

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge repository! In this challenge, I will be focusing on improving my coding skills and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. Each day, I will solve a coding problem or implement a DSA concept and upload the solution as a single CPP file.

## Overview

This repository contains my daily coding solutions as part of the 100 Days of Coding challenge. Through this challenge, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities, strengthen my understanding of DSA, and develop a consistent coding practice routine.

## Repository Structure

- Each day's solution is organized in a separate folder named `Day-X`, where X represents the day number.
- Inside each folder, you will find the CPP file for the solution, such as `day-X.cpp`.
- The CPP file contains the code for the respective day's problem or DSA implementation.

## Goal

My primary goal during this challenge is to improve my proficiency in DSA and gain confidence in solving coding problems. By dedicating 100 days to consistent coding practice, I aim to develop a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and problem-solving techniques.

## Topics Covered

Throughout this challenge, I will cover a wide range of DSA topics, including but not limited to:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## Follow Along

If you would like to follow along with my progress and stay updated on my coding journey, you can:
- Star this repository to show your support.
- Watch the repository to receive notifications for new solutions.

I encourage you to explore the repository and examine the solutions I provide. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Let's embark on this coding challenge together and make each day count. Happy coding!
